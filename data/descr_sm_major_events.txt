;;triggers will only be checked at the end of each round (including the start of the game)

;;to set triggers at game start in the descr_strat, do:
; trigger_status <trigger name>, true
;;to set it for all factions. If it's not a global event, you can also do
; trigger_status <trigger name>, <faction_name>, true
;;to set it for individual factions

;;if you want to enable/disable checking a particular event, do
; set_major_event_enabled <trigger name>, false

;;also note that the message uses the marian reforms message as a base, in case you were wondering
