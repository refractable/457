;;Note: this might LOOK like json, but I'm actually hijacking our txt parser to do this, so it might be kinda prone to breaking, sorry. Please note that the trailing commas are VERY IMPORTANT, DO NOT FORGET THEM
;;oh, also some decimals may be slightly off due to the fact that we pack them into <4 bytes to save space
